## FACE_RECOGNITION_SYSTEM_FOR_SMART_ATTENDANCE
This project implements a smart attendance system using facial recognition technology.

In the fast-paced technological landscape of the 21st century, traditional attendance tracking methods have become outdated and inefficient. The Face Recognition Attendance System represents a cutting-edge solution that leverages the power of facial recognition technology to streamline and enhance the attendance tracking process. This project aims to revolutionize the way organizations manage attendance by providing a secure, accurate, and automated system.

Face Recognition is a form of biometric software that maps an individual‚Äôs facial features mathematically and stores the data as a face print. The software consists of Deep Learning algorithms to compare a live capture or digital image to the stored face print in order to verify an individual‚Äôs identity.

### Dependencies
This project relies on several Python libraries. We recommend installing them using a package manager like pip.

Download the project code. You can either clone the repository using Git or download the zip file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: If you don't have pip installed, refer to the official documentation for your Python version on how to set it up.

### Running the System
Once the dependencies are installed (and optionally the database is set up), navigate to the project directory in your terminal/command prompt.

Locate the main script (usually named main.py or similar).

Execute the main script using the following command:

python main.py

This will activate the webcam and start the face recognition process.

The system will provide instructions or feedback through the console during operation. Refer to the main script or other project documentation for specific details on the output format.
